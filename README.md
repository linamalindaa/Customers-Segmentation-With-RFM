# Customers-Segmentation-With-RFM
RFM is a simple framework to quantify customer behaviour. Many people have extended  the RFM segmentation model and created variations.  Two notable versions are: 

RFD (Recency, Frequency, Duration) â€“ Duration here is time spent. 
Particularly useful  while analyzing consumer behaviour of viewership/readership/surfing oriented  products.  

RFE (Recency, Frequency, Engagement) 
Engagement can be a composite value  based on time spent on page, pages per visit, bounce rate, social media  engagement etc. 
Particularly useful for online businesses.
